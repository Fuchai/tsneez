# TODO

 - Why is this so much slower than Karpathy's?
 - Profile code in Chrome debugger
 - Implement (some version of) A-tSNE
 - Refactor interface to allow streaming input
 - Try different gradient descent methods
 - Refactor visualization to be more modular and support streaming


## Done
 - Try combining loops instead of using ndarray-ops (it's slower in getpIAndH)
 - Experiment with float sizes (leads to NaNs)
 - Reuse arrays liberally
 - Is ndarray using column major instead of row major format? (ndarray-scratch gives row-major)
